# Objective-TA (under development)
Objective-TA aims at being a multiplatform library built to cater towards an object oriented style of programming.
This project is heavily inspired by TA-lib. Objective-TA aims to take a similar approach to this library but adding in easy to use features in TA objects so that signals and trends can be easily linguistically conveyed within an OOP paradigm.
