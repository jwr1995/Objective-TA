# Objective-TA                                                                       
Objective-TA aims at being a dynamic multilingual library built to cater towards a feature-rich object oriented style of programming.

This project is heavily inspired by TA-lib. Objective-TA aims to take a similar approach to this library but adding in easy to use features in TA objects so that signals, trends and other information can be easily linguistically conveyed within an OOP paradigm.

The library is aimed towards independant traders and developers and so to reflect this, the initial languages Objective-TA will be developed in will be C#, Java & C++. If the project takes off and gains some community support then other languages will be considered such as Python or Ruby.
