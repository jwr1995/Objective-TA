# Objective-TA (under development)
Objective-TA aims at being a multilingual library built to cater towards an object oriented style of programming.
This project is heavily inspired by TA-lib. Objective-TA aims to take a similar approach to this library but adding in easy to use features in TA objects so that signals and trends can be easily linguistically conveyed within an OOP paradigm.

This library is aimed towards independant traders and developers and so to reflect this, the initial languages Objective-TA will be developed in will be C#, Java, C++ & Swift. If this project takes off then other languages will be considered such as Python or Ruby

*Understandably Swift may seem an odd choice as a priority, however given the nature of this library, it has potential use cases in mobile software (which could also mean porting to Kotlin (though from my understanding the Java library would suffice)) - we are aiming to be forward thinking here and to try and cater to as many people as possible over time.
